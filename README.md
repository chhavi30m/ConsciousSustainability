# Conscious Sustainability
Conscious revolutionizes the way we think and act on recycling and disposing waste - hazardous or not. <br>
It solves three main problems for the Indian demographic in terms of sustainability.<br>
1. <b>NO INCENTIVES</b> : There is a meagre amount paid in return for recycling, and since the end users are only small and medium-scale businesses, household recycling problems stay unsolved.<br>
  Conscious gives attractive rewards in form of discount codes to use.
2. <b>TEDIOUS PROCESS</b> : Calling the service or going to a slot machine is tedious to a major part of the Indian population. This reduces their outreach even more.<br>
  Conscious makes it effortless by giving pickup services on the doorstep.
3. <b>NO LESSONS INVOLVED</b>: When we rely on kabadiwalas and online services to get rid of the waste, we do not know the extensive steps taken to recycle something. <br>
  Conscious gives an insight as to how much effort goes into recycling, which allows for users to buy in a sustainable and viable manner.
Conscious is currently in the ideation phase.
